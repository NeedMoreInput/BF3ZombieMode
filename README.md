BF3 Zombie Mode
===============

## STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT USE YET

BF3 Zombie Mode is a ProCon 1.0 plugin that turns Team Deathmatch into a variant game called _Infected_ or _Zombie_.

When there are a minimum number of players spawned, all of the players are moved to the human team (US), except for one zombie (RU). Zombies can only use knife/defib/repair tool for weapons. Humans can use any weapon except explosives/missiles (configurable). Zombies are hard to kill. Every time a zombie kills a human, the human becomes infected and is moved to the zombie team. Humans win by killing a minimum number of zombies, like 50 (configurable). Zombies win by infecting all the humans.

The maximum number of players is half your server slots, so if you have a 64-slot server, you can have a max of 32 players.
